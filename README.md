# PZ-B41-BiggerNomadBackpacks
The default Nomad Backpack in Undead Survivors may look yuuuge, but it's actually pretty small in capacity compared to other modded backpacks like from Brita's Armor Pack. This mod makes it so the backpack is truly the biggest backpack in the game. It changes the capacity from 34 to 45.

**P.S.** This only works for newly spawned backpacks after you install this mod. Existing ones you may already have won't have the new capacity.

# New: Expanded Capacity for [ZuperCart - Carts & Trolleys](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2478768005)!

You might be wondering, "What do carts and trolleys have to do with the Nomad Backpack?" Well, not much at first glance! But since my mod boosts the Nomad Backpack’s capacity significantly, it kind of makes carts and trolleys feel a bit... redundant. So, to keep things balanced, if you’ve got [ZuperCart - Carts & Trolleys](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2478768005) installed, this mod will increase their capacity too—from 49 kg to a hefty 65 kg. Now, your trolleys will have some real muscle to compete with that backpack!
